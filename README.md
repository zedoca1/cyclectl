## Overview

CYCLECTL is a powerful web application designed to help teams manage their long-term production roadmaps efficiently. It provides a collaborative environment where team members can view, create, edit, and track tasks within shared projects, all governed by a robust role-based permission system.

## Features

- **Collaborative Project Management:** Work with your team on shared projects with granular access controls.
- **Role-Based Permissions:** Define roles (Owner, Editor, Viewer) to control who can perform actions within a project.

  - **Editor:** Can create, edit, reorder, and change task status.
  - **Viewer:** Can only view tasks and project details.
- **Kanban-style Board:** Organize tasks by month with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Task Management:** Create, edit, and track task progress with simplified day-only date inputs.
- **Floating Trash Bin:** Drag tasks to the trash bin (appears when dragging) to delete (owner only).
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bars per month.
- **Auto-Status Updates:** Tasks automatically move to 'in-progress' or 'overdue' based on current date.
- **Authentication:** Secure sign-in with GitHub, Google, or a magic link sent to your email.
- **JSON Import/Export:** Load tasks in bulk by pasting JSON data or export existing tasks as a JSON file (owner only).
- **Dark Glassmorphism UI:** Cyberpunk-inspired design with neon cyan accents.
